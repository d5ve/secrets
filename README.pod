=head1 NAME

secrets - Simple encrypted password and metadata store for commandline

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    All operations prompt for the master password before doing anything.

    Any operations which need the user to specify the name of a secret will
    prompt for it interactively, rather than passing it directly as an argument.
    This prevents the names of secrets appearing in the user's shell history.

    Usage: secrets [options] <action>

    Options:

        --file=FILE     - Optional file containing secrets.
                          Defaults to ~/.secrets
        --help|?        - Print the help docs. Default behaviour.


    Actions:

        list|ls         - List the available secret names.
        print           - Print the password and other metadata about a particular secret.
        add             - Add a new secret. This prompts for username/password etc.
        edit            - Edit an existing secret.
        delete          - Delete an existing secret.
        help            - Print help docs. Default action.


    Examples:
    
        # List the names of the stored secrets.
        secrets list
        secrets ls

        # Print to STDOUT the username/password and other metadata about
        # a secret.
        # You will be prompted for the name of the secret to print.
        secrets print 

        # Add/Edit/Delete a secret.
        # You will be prompted for the name of the secret.
        secrets add
        secrets edit
        secrets delete 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

secrets is a simple commandline password keeper, written in perl, which
maintains an encrypted file containing a list of secrets. A secret is a set of
standard data like username, password, URL, plus a block of unstructured
metadata. This allows you to also store things like memorable dates or places,
favourite sports teams, mother's maiden names for each place you need a login.
Being able to make all this data up for each login, and remember it, means that
it's less likely that someone could masquerade as you.

=head1 CAVEATS

This script does no file locking, so running it in parallel may result in data
loss, where the last writer wins.
